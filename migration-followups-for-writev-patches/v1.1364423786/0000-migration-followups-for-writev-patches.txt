Subject: [PATCH 0/6] migration: followups for writev patches

This series fixes a few small problems in Orit's writev patches:

1) socket_put_buffer is not needed anymore and can be dropped (patch 1);

2) sendmsg could do a partial write even for a blocking socket, in
case it is interrupted by a signal. This should not happen for
migration, but it is relatively easy to fix in iov_send_recv (patches
2 to 5);

3) recent libvirt will always use fd migration, and thus will not
benefit from the writev speedups.  fd migration also uses FILE*, which
incurs an extra copy.  Patch 6 fixes both issues.

Thanks,

Paolo
