Subject: [PATCH 0/2] more tcg-arm cleanups

The first patch really ought to get into 1.5.

The second patch is a re-done version of the 19/19 patch from version 5
of the previous patch series.  We had dropped that due to wanting to
avoid 16MB assumption changes.  The revised patch merely changes how we
handle the constant that needs loading.

Please apply.
