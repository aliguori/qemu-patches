Subject: [PATCH 0/7] qtest: add libqos

This is libqos support for qtest.  A few things are omitted from
the RFC review in order to help get this merged quickly.  Notably,
there's still no way to tear down a device (pci_iounmap is hard to
implement well).  I haven't attempted to refactor i2c support and
I have not introduced convenience macros.

But otherwise, I think the series is now in very good shape and
mergable.
