Subject: [PATCH 0/1] virtio-net: dynamic network offloads configuration

From: Dmitry Fleytman <dfleytma@redhat.com>

This patch implements recently accepted by virtio-spec
dynamic offloads configuration feature.
See commit message for details.

V4 changes:
  1. Feature definitions re-used for command bitmask
  2. Command data made uint64
  3. Commit messsages fixed

Reported-by: Rusty Russell rusty@rustcorp.com.au

V3 changes:
  1. Compat macro added
  2. Feature name beautification

V2 changes:
  1. _GUEST_ added to command and feature names
  2. Live migration logic fixed

Reported-by: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com>

One of recently introduced Windows features (RSC)
requires network driver to be able to enable and disable
HW LRO offload on the fly without device reinitialization.

Current Virtio specification doesn't support this requirement.
The solution proposed by following spec patch is to add
a new control command for this purpose.

The same solution may be used in Linux driver for ethtool interface
implementation.
