Subject: [PATCH 0/4] ui/cocoa.m: Fix compiler and runtime warnings on 10.8

These patches fix various compiler and runtime warnings QEMU provokes
on MacOSX 10.8. The first two fix a leak and some deprecated functions
which cause warnings in the system log when QEMU runs. The second
two avoid some functions which cause compile time warnings about
use of functions deprecated in 10.6.

I believe from my reading of the documentation that these changes
should still work OK on 10.3, but I don't have any way of testing that.

Andreas: I don't write much ObjC so I don't really have a feel for
what is good coding style. I mostly tried to follow the existing
code (eg "//" style comments) and QEMU's C style (eg 80 cols max).
I'm happy to change any of the indentation or whatever to suit your
preferences.

With this patch set the only remaining compile time warnings from clang
on 10.8 are about deprecated methods in audio/coreaudio.c.

Changes v1->v2:
 * rebased and fixed up following recent console changes
