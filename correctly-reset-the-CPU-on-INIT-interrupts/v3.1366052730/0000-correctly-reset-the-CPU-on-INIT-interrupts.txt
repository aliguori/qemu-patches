Subject: [PATCH 0/2] correctly reset the CPU on INIT interrupts

These patches finally implement INIT entirely in userspace.  The problem
here was that the CPU was being reset after kvm_arch_reset_vcpu is called.
This made it harder to hook into the reset process and put APs into
KVM_MP_STATE_INIT_RECEIVED state (instead of KVM_MP_STATE_UNINITIALIZED
which is the state after a system reset).

In this series, patch 1 removes the kvm_arch_reset_vcpu from the generic
code, and moves it into each architecture's CPU reset callback (half of
our supported architectures do not need the callback anyway).

With this in place, patch 2 can add a similar x86-specific callback that
is used after an INIT reset.  Apart from this callback, the code for
INITs is shared entirely between the userspace irqchip and in-kernel
irqchip cases.

v2->v3: add stub kvm_arch_reset_vcpu for s390

Paolo Bonzini (2):
  kvm: reset state from the CPU's reset method
  kvm: forward INIT signals coming from the chipset
