Subject: [PATCH 0/9] x86: feature words array (v11) + "feature-words" property

This series includes the previous "replace cpuid_*features fields with a feature
word array" series.

The first 4 patches already have a Reviewed-by from Igor, they correspond to v10
plus a small indent fix requested by him.

As the cpuid_*features series was holding my "feature-words"/"filtered-features"
series (previously sent as RFC), I am now sending both as a single series, to
try to get "feature-words"/"filtered-features" some attention and try to get it
included in 1.5.

The "feature-words"/"filtered-features" mechanism is very important for libvirt,
to allow it to ensure the guest is getting the required set of CPU features, as
configured by the user.
