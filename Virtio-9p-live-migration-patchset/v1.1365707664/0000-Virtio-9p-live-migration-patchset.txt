Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Virtio-9p live migration patchset

This patchset is a rework of the 9p live migration patchs made a few years ago
by Aneesh.
As the new vmstate API doesn't support linked list so the old API is used.

Beno√Æt Canet (4):
  migration: Create the pre migration flush hook infrastructure.
  virtio-9p: Add support for 9p migration.
  virtio-9p: Wait for 9p operations to complete before migration.
  virtio-9p: Remove migration blockers.
