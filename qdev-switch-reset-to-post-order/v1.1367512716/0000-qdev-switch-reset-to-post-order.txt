Subject: [PATCH 0/3] qdev: switch reset to post-order

I was going to keep these for 1.6, but since they have been tested
by the user and myself, and they fix a regression, it can be worthwhile
to include these in 1.5.

qdev reset (qdev_reset_all/qbus_reset_all) is currently done in
pre-order.  This is not right, because it means the parent devices
cannot expect anything about the children devices' state during the
reset callback.

With the traversal done *before* invoking the bus-reset callback,
there is no way for the bus-reset callback to take care of the device
tree traversal.  This is currently done only for PCI, which requires
some adjustments.

This fixes a crash in resetting the LSI SCSI adapter, as reported and
tested by Claudio Bley.

Paolo Bonzini (3):
  pci: do not export pci_bus_reset
  qdev: allow both pre- and post-order vists in qdev walking functions
  qdev: switch reset to post-order
