Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add some tracepoints for clarification of the cause of
 troubles

This series adds tracepoints for helping us clarify the cause of
troubles. Virtualization on Linux is composed of some components such
as qemu, kvm, libvirt, and so on. So it is very important to clarify
firstly and swiftly the cause of troubles is on what component of
them. Although qemu has useful information of this because it stands
among kvm, libvirt and guest, it doesn't output the information by
trace or log system.
These patches add tracepoints which lead to reduce the time of the
clarification. We'd like to add the tracepoints as the first set
because, based on our experience, we've found out they must be useful
for an investigation in the future. Without those tracepoints,
we had a really hard time investigating a problem since the problem's
reproducibility was quite low and there was no clue in the dump of
qemu.

Changes from v1:
Add arg to kvm_ioctl, kvm_vm_ioctl, kvm_vcpu_ioctl tracepoints.
Add cpu_index to kvm_vcpu_ioctl, kvm_run_exit tracepoints.

Kazuya Saito (2):
  kvm-all: add kvm_ioctl, kvm_vm_ioctl, kvm_vcpu_ioctl tracepoints
  kvm-all: add kvm_run_exit tracepoint
