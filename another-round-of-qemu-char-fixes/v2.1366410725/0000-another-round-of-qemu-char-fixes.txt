Subject: [PATCH 0/4] another round of qemu-char fixes

These three patches fix the bugs that Gerd reported.

The first patches try to make the code consistent (which should avoid
that half of the drivers bark with CRITICAL messages from glib) and
also fix detection of pty connections so that they do not go berserk
with polling.  This is likely the same failure reported by Michael Hines,
but I couldn't reproduce it with "-serial pty", only with the monitor.

The last patch works around a glib bug that happens on RHEL6 and Wheezy,
where destroying a source from a finalize callback can deadlock the
GMainLoop.  This bug locks up QEMU when a socket chardev's client
disconnects.

I tested the pty fix on F18 and Gerd tested it on RHEL6.  I tested
the socket fix on RHEL6.

I believe these patches let us revert commit 893986f (main-loop: drop
the BQL if the I/O appears to be spinning, 2013-04-05).
