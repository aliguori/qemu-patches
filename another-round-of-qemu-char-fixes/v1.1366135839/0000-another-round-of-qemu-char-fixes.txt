Subject: [PATCH 0/3] another round of qemu-char fixes

I'm happy to say that I'm not touching IOWatchPoll (well, almost: only
for consistency).  Instead, these patches try to make the code consistent
(thus avoiding CRITICAL messages from glib) and to fix detection of pty
connections; Gerd reported that it went berserk with polling.  I think it
is the same failure reported by Michael Hines, but I couldn't reproduce
it with "-serial pty", only with the monitor.

Paolo Bonzini (3):
  qemu-char: use consistent idiom for removing sources
  qemu-char: simplify pty polling
  qemu-char: correct return value from chr_read functions
