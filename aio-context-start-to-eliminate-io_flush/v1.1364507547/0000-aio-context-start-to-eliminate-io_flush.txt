Subject: [PATCH 0/3] aio-context start to eliminate io_flush

Mike and I spent some time talking about how to move forward with
AioContext vs. glib.  I think the best proposal so far is to add
a common API on top of the *aio* interfaces and the existing
qemu_set_fd_handler main loop functions.

Then we get code sharing while still having multiple main loop
implementations until we can converge on a single one since the users
will consume the same interface at least.

The only thing standing in the way is the inability to map the semantics
of io_flush.  I think an easy way to do this is to keep track of the
events registered through *aio* and let aio_flush() block as long as
any event is registered.

That's precisely what this series starts to do.  It's untested and
extremely incomplete but I wanted to get some feedback first before we
put any serious effort into this and make sure it's an agreeable
approach.
