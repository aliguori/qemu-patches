Subject: [PATCH 0/2] configure: fix coroutine backend selection logic

The main aim of this patchset is patch 2, which changes the coroutine
backend selection logic so that it goes 'ucontext -> sigaltstack'
rather than 'ucontext -> gthread', since the gthread backend is
broken. To do this properly on all platforms we have to refactor
the code a bit (which it needed anyway).

The first patch here is a generic configure cleanup to how we print
error messages, which I wanted for the third patch because otherwise
the various error paths would have been rather verbose.

Changes v2->v3:
 * canonicalize user-facing 'windows' backend name to 'win32' so
   we pick up the right filename for windows builds

Changes v1->v2:
 * fix the tests makefile too
 * CONFIG_COROUTINE_BACKEND=foo rather than CONFIG_FOO_COROUTINE=y;
   this simplifies both the configure code and the makefiles
 * dropped the 'move upper()' patch as no longer needed (in this
   series, anyway)

Peter Maydell (2):
  configure: Provide and use convenience error reporting function
  configure: Don't fall back to gthread coroutine backend
