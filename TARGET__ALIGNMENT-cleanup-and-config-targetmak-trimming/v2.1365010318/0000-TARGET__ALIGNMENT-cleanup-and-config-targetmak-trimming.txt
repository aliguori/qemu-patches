Subject: [PATCH 00/10] TARGET_*_ALIGNMENT cleanup,
 and config-target.mak trimming

This series expands on the one I sent yesterday, but also fixes some
confusion between target (CPU) and ABI types in linux-user/elfload.c.

target_short/int/llong and the corresponding unsigned types are renamed
to abi_short/int/llong, and TARGET_*_ALIGNMENT is similarly renamed to
ABI_*_ALIGNMENT.  target_long/ulong, which identify the register width
in the CPU, do not have special alignment anymore.  Core dumps are
changed to use the new types, with fixes to include the full 64-bit
contents of mipsn32 registers.

Patches 1-3 are new.  Patches 4-7 are also new, and replace patches 1-2
in the previous submission.  Patches 8-10 are the same as patches 3-5
in the previous submission, with a fix for -lm link errors in patch 9.
