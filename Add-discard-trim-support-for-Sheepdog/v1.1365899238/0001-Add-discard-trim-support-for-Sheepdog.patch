Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Add discard/trim support for Sheepdog

From: Liu Yuan <tailai.ly@taobao.com>

Trim/discard is a command that allows VM to inform underlying storage system to
release unused space. Sheepdog takes use of this command to release unused
objects for better thin-provision.

This patch set aims to add trim/discard support to both Sheepdog and QEMU's
Sheepdog block driver.

There are first 3 patches for Sheepdog and the last one is for QEMU.

Thanks,
Yuan
