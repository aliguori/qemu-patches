Subject: [PATCH 0/2] block: Add support for Secure Shell (ssh) block device.

Since v6:

- This fixes a rather serious race condition in the previous versions,
  which only manifested itself when using 'snapshot=on'.

- Store the attributes (like filesize) in the state.

- Macros for LOCK/UNLOCK to make debugging simpler.

- Added an ssh driver to libguestfs and tested with that:

Rich.
