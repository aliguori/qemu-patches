Subject: [PATCH 1/3] block: Add support for Secure Shell (ssh) block device.

Changes since v8:

- Implement the suggestions of Stefan Hajnoczi.

- Add host_key_check parameter, which you can use like this:

  ssh://[...]?host_key_check=no     # skip the check entirely
  ssh://[...]?host_key_check=yes    # the default, uses known_hosts

  # or check for a specific host key fingerprint:
  ssh://[...]?host_key_check=md5:<usual SSH host key fingerprint>
  ssh://[...]?host_key_check=sha1:<SHA1 fingerprint>

Note that I cannot persuade OpenSSH to display the SHA1 fingerprint of
a host key, so sha1: is not tested.

A possible extension to this would be to check for the exact key (not
the fingerprint, which is just a hash of the key), although in this
case the URI would be very long indeed, possibly longer than URIs are
supposed to be in some cases.

Rich.
