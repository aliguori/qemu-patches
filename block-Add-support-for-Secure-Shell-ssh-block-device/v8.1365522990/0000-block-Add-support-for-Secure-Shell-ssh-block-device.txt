Subject: [PATCH 0/3] block: Add support for Secure Shell (ssh) block device.

Changes since v7:

- fsync (ie. bdrv_co_flush_to_disk) is now supported, *if* you have
the following patches to libssh2 and OpenSSH:

https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1798
(OpenSSH: accepted, but not upstream)

http://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2013-04/0006.shtml
(libssh2: posted)

I tested 3 combinations (without libssh2 patch; with libssh2 patch and
without OpenSSH support; with libssh2 patch and with OpenSSH support),
and all work.

Rich.
