Subject: [PATCH 0/3] block: make qmp_transaction extendable

  This serial will package backing chain snapshot code as one case to make it
possible adding more operations later. It is splitted out from previous snapshot
patches since it have slightly different purpose, adjusting qmp_transaction.
Previous patch and discuss could be found at:
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-01/msg00645.html

  I can't find a way to split patch 2/3 to smaller ones unless breaking the build,
so kepted it as a relative larger patch.

Wenchao Xia (3):
  1 block: add function deappend()
  2 block: adjust qmp_transaction to be extendable
  3 block: change rollback sequence in qmp_transaction
