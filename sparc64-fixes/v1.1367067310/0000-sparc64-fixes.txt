Subject: [PATCH 0/3] sparc64 fixes

Various fixes:
On the real hardware IRQ lines of the PCI bus are not shared.
In the previous QEMU implementation before this series, all PCI devices
used the IRQ line 0. Combined with auto-clearing interrupts this made
the guest OS extremely unstable. The test case is installing
Debian Wheezy / sparc64:

Without the patches the install process hangs at random places between 6% and 60%.
With this series the installation succeeds.
Please note that the patch 3/3 requires updating OpenBIOS.

Artyom Tarasenko (3):
  sparc64: allow 64 IRQ lines
  sparc64: fix loosing interrupts
  sparc64: use direct interrupt mapping for PCI devices
