Subject: [PATCH 12/12] linux-user: AArch64 requires at least 3.8.0

From: Alexander Graf <agraf@suse.de>

Glibc 1.17 checks for the host kernel version on startup. Unfortunately,
it also checks whether the host kernel version is recent enough for the
target to run at all.

Since AArch64 support only got introduced in 3.8.0, that means that glibc
refuses to run on any older kernel version than that.

To allow for execution of linux-user guests even on older host kernels,
let's always fake the kernel version to 3.8.0 on AArch64 guests.

Do this by forcing CONFIG_UNAME_RELEASE=3.8.0 in config_target_mak
for aarch64.
