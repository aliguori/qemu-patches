Subject: [PATCH 0/3] acpi: more infrastructure cleanups

I wanted to help Laszlo completely move ACPI tables out of seabios in
time for 1.5, but had to put out some fires so didn't manage to do this
in time, and going offline for now.

Meanwhile, here is some refactoring that I did complete.  This does not
do much by itself, but works fine for me and will be helpful down the
road.

This includes a couple of patches I posted previously
and another one on top.

Pls consider for 1.5.


Michael S. Tsirkin (3):
  acpi: move declarations from pc.h to acpi.h
  acpi: add acpi_table_add_hdr
  acpi.h: make it self contained
