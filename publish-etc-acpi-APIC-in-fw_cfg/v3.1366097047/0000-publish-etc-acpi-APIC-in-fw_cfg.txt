Subject: [PATCH 0/7] publish etc/acpi/APIC in fw_cfg

v1 blurb:

  This series exports the MADT (APIC) ACPI table under the new
  "etc/acpi/APIC" fw_cfg file. I sought to follow the requirements set
  forth in [1], the new table is only visible in the patched/patched
  case. I cross-tested { master, patched } qemu with { master, patched }
  seabios (the APIC, DSDT and RSDT tables) using guest acpidump and
  dmesg.

  The -acpitable command line option is purposely ignored based on the
  last paragraph of [2]; the user isn't supposed to pass APIC with that
  option.

  checkpatch.pl complains a little but (as last time) it's a false
  alarm.

  The series is bisectable.

v2:
- address (1) in
  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/206146/focus=206195>:

  - rebase to Paolo's recent series
    <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/206196/focus=206278>,

  - patch 2 is new, fixes style of function parameter references in a
    comment [mst],

  - patch 6 is new, moves a macro definition [mst],

  - patch 7 should be structured more logically now, plus the commit
    message has grown some bits related to licensing [mst].
    acpi_table_fill_hdr() is kept distinct from the -acpitable switch's
    implementation on purpose, similarly to pc_acpi_install() in v1.

- Tested APIC / DSDT / RSDT against contents saved from v1.

v3:
- rebased to current master 24a6e7f4,
- added Michael's S-o-b to 6/7 [Eric Blake],
- added Dave Frodin's relicensing ACK to 7/7, originally sent to Michael
  in private [Michael Tsirkin],
- slightly reworded 7/7's commit message where it credits Michael's
  prototype [Eric Blake].
