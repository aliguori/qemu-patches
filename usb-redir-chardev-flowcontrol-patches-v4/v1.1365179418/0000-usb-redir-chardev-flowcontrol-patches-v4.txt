Subject: [PATCH 0/7] usb-redir chardev flowcontrol patches v4

Hi Gerd,

Here is v4 of the series adding watch support to the spicevmc chardev
backend. This version resolved all outstanding discussions about this
patch-set, can you please include these in your next spice pull-req to
Anthony?

Note this also includes a few virtio-consoled bugfixes which were found
during the development of this series.

Changes in v2:
-Address Amit's review of "[PATCH 2/8] virtio-console: Remove any pending
watches on close"
-Drop 2 spice-qemu-char cleanup patches as Gerd has added them to his v5
-series
-Add a (forward ported) patch from Alon Levy to fix a long standing
 spice-qemu-char migration issue in a way which should be acceptable
-upstream

Changes in v3:
-Rebased on top of latest master (some trivial manual conflict resolution)
-Dropped Alon's patch for the spice-qemu-char migration issue, this is fixed
 differently in another series which is already par of the latest master
-Add a new patch:
  usb-serial: Remove double call to qemu_chr_add_handlers( NULL )
-Fixed a checkpatch issue in:
  usb-redir: Add flow control support

Changes in v4:
-Rebased on top of latest master (some trivial manual conflict resolution)
-Address Amit's review of "[PATCH 1/7] virtio-console: Also throttle when
 less was written then requested"
-Drop patches included in the usb.79 pull-req
-Add a new patch: "[PATCH 6/7] spice-qemu-char: vmc_write: Don't write more
 bytes then requested"

Thanks & Regards,

Hans
