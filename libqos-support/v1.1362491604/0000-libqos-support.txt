Subject: [PATCH 0/8] libqos support

This is a not completely polished version of libqos that includes PCI
support.  I haven't gone through the patches thoroughly yet so I've got
it marked as RFC.  It works and is functionally complete.  I know the
files are missing copyrights though and the commit messages need some
work.  I also haven't run checkpatch on the patches yet.

I've included a test of the i440fx but not a virtio-blk test.  There's a
lot more infrastructure (block and virtio) needed for that.  That has been
what's been holding up this series.  But since it's become a bottleneck
for other people, I decided to split these bits off and save the virtio
bits for another day.

Note that the pam test is pretty slow because it does a tremendous number
of byte memory accesses.  On my laptop, it comes in around two seconds
which isn't that bad.

Regards,

Anthony Liguori
