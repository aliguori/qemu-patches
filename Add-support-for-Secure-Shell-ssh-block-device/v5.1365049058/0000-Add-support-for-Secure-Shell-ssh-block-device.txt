Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add support for Secure Shell (ssh) block device.

This is version 5 of the patch to add a Secure Shell (ssh) block
device to qemu.  Most recently this was discussed here:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-03/threads.html#04845

Some changes since last time:

 - I have addressed almost all of Stefan comments, but see my email to
   him above.

 - ./check -ssh can be used to run io tests.  Note the -qcow2 ones
   won't work.

I haven't done anything about authentication, so this patch still
requires ssh-agent to be set up, and the right key to be present in
known_hosts.

Rich.
