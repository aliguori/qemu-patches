Subject: [PATCH 0/5] qcow2.py: dump metadata

This series includes several improvements to qcow2.py, mostly
the ability to dump the L1 and L2 tables for a full backing
chain.

Doing this completely would require support for all image formats,
not just qcow2.  To cover the common cases, I included support
for raw backing files.

The right thing to do perhaps would be to add the read-metadata
patches from the in-place QED conversion summer of code project,
but I wanted to throw out these anyway if anyone has comments.
