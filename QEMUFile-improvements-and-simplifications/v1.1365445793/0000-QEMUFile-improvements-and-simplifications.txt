Subject: [PATCH 0/4] QEMUFile improvements and simplifications

This fixes Kevin's reported regression with savevm, and simplifies the
QEMUFile code further.

Patch 2 could be made a bit smaller at the expense of fixing the
regression in the last patch only.  I prefer to fix the bug earlier.

Tested with Autotest.

Paolo Bonzini (4):
  migration: set f->is_write and flush in add_to_iovec
  migration: use a single I/O operation when writev_buffer is not defined
  migration: drop is_write complications
  migration: simplify writev vs. non-writev logic
