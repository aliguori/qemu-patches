Subject: [PATCH 0/1] ehci_free_packet: Discard finished packets when the queue
 is halted v2

Hi Gerd,

Here is a v2 of the patch I send yesterday, changed in v2 is that the warning
is only printed when packets with a status of success are dropped, since on
a regular stall or disconnect chances are all other packets in the queue 
also have completed with an error status when we process the queue.

This is a normal condition, on which we should not warn / log.

Regards,

Hans
