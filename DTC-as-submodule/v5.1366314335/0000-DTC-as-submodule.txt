These two patches add and use dtc as a submodule as per the RFC:

There is a remaining action item to mandate libfdt for arm/microblaze and PPC
which is left as follow up work for after review of this series.

Also fixed the configure to properly build pixman when cross compiling.

changed since v4:
Use error_exit in configure
changed since v3:
Rebase against recent configure devls.
changed since v2:
Fixed P1 implementation (PMM review)
Fixed CC/AR/LD quoting issue P3 (PMM review)
Addressed PMM review
changed since v1:
Fixed cross compilation of submodules (new P1)
Fixed passing of ARFLAGS to dtc submake


Peter Crosthwaite (3):
  configure: Put cross compile flags in EXTRA_CFLAGS
  dtc: add submodule
  configure/Make: Build libfdt from submodule DTC
