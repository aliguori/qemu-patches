Subject: [PATCH 00/10] target-i386: convert CPU features into properties

It's a simplified rewrite of previous series, since then cleanups from it
were applied to master and I left out kvm_check_features_against_host() and
listflags() patches as not directly related to make series simpler.
They could follow as separate cleanups later.
Also setting defaults with static properties left to post CPU subclasses
conversion when it could be done in a more straightforward way and only
once.

v6-v7:
* convert globals check_cpuid, enforce_cpuid and  hyperv_* to fields of
  CPUState
* Make PropertyInfo-s static
* maintain legacy kvmclock semantic in cpu_x86_parse_featurestr()
* existing properties code are not moved around, just fixed signatures where
  it's needed and used visitors. 

v5-v6:
* when converting feature names to property names, replace '_' with '-'
* separate patches converting existing dynamic properties into one, were
  squashed into one [1/9] and change tested with virt-test(next).
* patches that were touching +-foo features are squashed into one [9/9],
  to avoid behavior change between them(f-kvmclock property).
* the rest of conversions were basicaly rebased on top of current qom-cpu-next
  tree, with small corrections
