Subject: [PATCH 0/7] implement power chip

By now, all devices of QEMU do not have much more
power management consideration, for example, if
system do suspend, it will call all registered notifiers,
this was loosely required, and the code to do power management
state transition seems just do 'ugly emulation', rather than be
conscious with whole system devices, same condition with reset.
shutdown, in real world, commonly all devices' power are controlled
by a power chip, then all power sequence can be done just
issue commands or raise signals connected to this chip.
so, I come across an idea to implement qdev'ed power device, and
make all qdev struct of devices aware of self power management(connect
power signal with power chip, then respond to power state change), this will
bring tidy power management, and the emulation will more like what
happened in real world.

Of course, it's only a patch-set for RFC, I'd like to ask all 
developers to help correct this idea, if it's worth to implement, 
I'll go head to refactor more.

v2: change from functions calling to signal connecting between
	power chip and devices.
