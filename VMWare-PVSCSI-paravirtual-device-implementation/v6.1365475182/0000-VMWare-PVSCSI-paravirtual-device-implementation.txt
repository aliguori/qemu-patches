Implementation supports of all the device features.
Code was tested on different OSes:
    Fedora 15
    Ubuntu 10.4

    Windows 2008 64bit
    Windows 2008 32bit

    Windows 2003 32bit

Changes since V5:
1. SCSI hotplug support added
2. Code rebase for mainline

Changes since V4:
Array access checks and minor beautification as suggested by Blue Swirl.
Reported-by: Blue Swirl <blauwirbel@gmail.com>

Changes since V3:
1. Utility function strpadcpy() and structure changes in SCSI devices removed from v4 since they are already applied to scsi-next from v3 by Paolo.
2. Logging ported to use tracepoints. All ifdef based custom macros for logging removed.
3. The vmware_utils.h is no longer present with necessary macros inlined.
4. pvscsi.h replaced by vmw_pvscsi.h from linux kernel with some minor modifications to build in qemu.
5. Various fixes and beautification as suggested by Blue Swirl.
