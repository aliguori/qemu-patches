Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Trivial patches for 2013-05-02

Hello.

As Stefan Hajnoczi mentioned yesterday, I'll try to maintain qemu-trivial
patch queue.  So here goes the first pull request, with just 3 really
trivial patches.  For now I push the changes into my repository, available
also as http://git.corpit.ru/?p=qemu.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/trivial-patches .

The patches included this week are really trivial.  There are a few other
patches pending on the qemu-trivial mailing list, but due to several reasons
I weren't able to do any good testing/review of thes - will do that for the
next pull request.  There are a series of holidays here in Russia, first is
1st-2nd May "International workers day", plus a weekend, and second is the
Victory day (9th may, end of World War II), also with a weekend, and everyone
here goes out of city.  That's why I'm sending pull request at Thursday
instead of usual Friday.

For the other patches already submitted to -trivial, I've the following plans:
 "translate: remove redundantly included qemu/timer.h" by liguang --
   pending Signed-off-by.
 "m25p80.c: Sync Flash chip list with Linux" by Ed Maste --
   I want to actually take a look and compare the resulting thing with the
   list in linux kernel.  Will hopefully do for the next pull request.
 "bsd-user: OS-agnostic 64-bit SYSCTL types" by Ed Maste --
   also I want to verify that it works, for that I'll have to install some
   FreeBSD guest or maybe find the changes in their #include's to see what's
   it all about.
 "SMBUS module update" by Maksim_Ratnikov --
   I don't think this qualifies for -trivial, and the submission is done in
   html form.  Pending resubmission in correct form to qemu-devel and the
   appropriate maintainer.

So even if I included all changes so far, the pull requests weren't much
larger anyway :)

Also, I'm still trying to figure out how qemu-trivial is, and should be,
maintained, and doing stuff without any automation, so things may be a
bit rough for the first time.  This is, ofcourse, fixable later ;)

As mentioned above, due to holiday I won't be available until Monday.

Below is the actual pull request, with whole diff appended (since it is
rather small), for easier review.  Please pull :)
