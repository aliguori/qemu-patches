Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Initial VHDX support


Differences from v2:


Patch 2/4:  changed 2 uint8_t[16] to MSGUID (Kevin)
            renamed all strucs to proper style (Kevin)
            indentations / style (Kevin)
            Removed/fixed outdated comments (Stefan)
            dropped vhdx_header_padded (Kevin)            
            
Patch 3/4:  removed hunk that was meant for old patch 5/5 (Fam)
            check VHDX header version field (Fam)
            validate file type id in open and not just probe (Kevin)
            allow headers with seq # of 0 if other header is invalid (Kevin)
            fixed masking typo for parent meta present (Kevin)
            removed error check for 512-byte sectors (Kevin)
            verify region and metadata table guid are unique (Kevin)
            removed signed/unsigned comparisons (Stefan)
            sanity checking on rt.entry_count (Stefan)
            use clz_() instead of inline code (Stefan)
            bat_rt.length sanity check - compute it rather
               than trust the entry length (Stefan)

Patch 5 (v2): Dropped

This adds the initial support for VHDX image files.  

It currently only supports read operations of VHDX, for fixed and dynamic files.

Notably, the following is not yet supported:
    * Differencing files
    * Log replay (so we will refuse to open any images that are not 'clean')
    * .bdrv_create()
    * write operations other than to the header


Jeff Cody (4):
  qemu: add castagnoli crc32c checksum algorithm
  block: vhdx header for the QEMU support of VHDX images
  block: initial VHDX driver support framework - supports open and probe
  block: add read-only support to VHDX image format.
