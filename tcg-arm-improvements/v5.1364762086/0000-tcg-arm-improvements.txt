Subject: [PATCH 00/19] tcg-arm improvements

Changes v4-v5:
  * Incorprate stack realignment into frame size, instead of pushing r12.

  * Disassemble prologues with -d out_asm.

Changes v3-v4:
  * Local stack frame fix has been reworked to be independant of the rest
    of the change set, making it possible to cherry-pick to stable.

  * While doing that, I've dropped the patch that pulled the epilogue
    into the exit_tb expansion, as the stated reason (one insn in the
    epilogue) is no longer true -- there's the stack pop as well.  This
    obviated several of the changes that PMM suggested.

  * I've dropped all of the changes to goto_tb, as Aurelien tried the
    same thing a while ago, and there were reports of no real speedup,
    ascribed to Dcache pollution.

Hopefully I've addressed all of the outstanding comments to which there
is still code that applies.  The patch set is available at
