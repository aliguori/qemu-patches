Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Drop support for qdev taddr properties

There is currently only one user of the qdev taddr (target addr,
now hwaddr) property code, and that user is wrong anyway, since the
property it's trying to set isn't actually a taddr property.
Fix the erroneous use in sm501 and drop all the taddr property code.

The justification for dropping the support is that a device should
generally not be exposing properties whose width (conceptually)
depends on the target CPU type. (This is the same rationale for
not supporting hwaddr fields in migration state.) Instead the
device should expose either a 32 bit or 64 bit property, depending
on what the actual hardware does.

Changes v1->v2:
 * no functional changes, just rebased since Paolo's moved
   everything around and the old patches won't apply
