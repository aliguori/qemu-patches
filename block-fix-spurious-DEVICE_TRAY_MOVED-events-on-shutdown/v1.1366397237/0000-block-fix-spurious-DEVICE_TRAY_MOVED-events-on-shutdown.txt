Subject: [PATCH 0/2] block: fix spurious DEVICE_TRAY_MOVED events on shutdown

Hi,

This fixes a regression introduced by commit 9ca111544, as detailed in
patch 2/2, by moving bdrv_dev_change_media_cb() calls to callers of
bdrv_close() that need it, as suggested by Kevin.

Luiz Capitulino (2):
  block: make bdrv_dev_change_media_cb() public
  block: move bdrv_dev_change_media_cb() to callers that really need it
