Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Support for LED state extension to Qemu VNC server

Hi guys,

This patch series tries to add support for LED state
extension to Qemu VNC server. The proposal has been sent
few days ago as link below:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-04/msg01421.html

This is just an initial implementation, and has not been
completely tested. To catch up Qemu 1.5 soft freeze, I'd
like to send it out to have your suggestion. Please let me
know if this seems like the direction we should be headed.

Your suggestions and comments are very appreciated!

Thanks
