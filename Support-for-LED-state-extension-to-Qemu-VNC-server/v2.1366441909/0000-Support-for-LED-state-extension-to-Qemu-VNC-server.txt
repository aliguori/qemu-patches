Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Support for LED state extension to Qemu VNC server

Hi guys,

This patch series tries to add support for LED state
extension to Qemu VNC server. The proposal has been sent
few days ago as link below:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2013-04/msg01421.html

Hi Anthony,

This series has not been completely tested, it takes longer than
expected for that I found that it needs to add hack on gtk-vnc 
not just gvncfb, so still mark it as RFC. Send it out first to make
sure I understood your previous suggestions correctly. Please let
me know if this seems like the direction we should be headed.

Your suggestions and comments are very appreciated!

Thanks

Changes since v1:
  - Address the comments from Anthony includes:
    - Use Pseudo-encoding for led state;
    - Get rid of send_ext_leds_state_ack;
    - Add document for the led state Pseudo-encoding.
