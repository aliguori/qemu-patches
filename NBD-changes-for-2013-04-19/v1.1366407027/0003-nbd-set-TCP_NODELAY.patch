Subject: [PATCH 3/3] nbd: set TCP_NODELAY

From: Stefan Hajnoczi <stefanha@redhat.com>

Disable the Nagle algorithm to reduce latency.  Note this means we must
also use TCP_CORK when sending header followed by payload to avoid
fragmenting lots of little packets.  The previous patch took care of
that.
