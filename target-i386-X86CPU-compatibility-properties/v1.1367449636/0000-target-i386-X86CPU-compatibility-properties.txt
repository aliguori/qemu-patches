Subject: [PATCH 0/4] target-i386: X86CPU compatibility properties

Hello,

It's easier adapting the infrastructure to our needs than working around it:
X86CPU already has QOM properties today. What's lacking is model subclasses,
and with the one X86CPU type its global properties are overwritten by models.
But we already know the designated naming scheme for the models!

So let's simply prepare compat_props for CPU models and make sure they are
already picked up today.

This works just fine for changing the 486 CPUID model value and avoids to
redo the PC part once we have X86CPU subclasses.
Tested using: ./QMP/qom-get /machine/icc-bridge/icc/child[0].model

For changing n270 CPUID flags we'll still need to resort to Eduardo's proposed
helper functions for now.

Regards,
Andreas
