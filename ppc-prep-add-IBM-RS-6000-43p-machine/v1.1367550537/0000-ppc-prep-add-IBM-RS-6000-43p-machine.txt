Subject: [PATCH 0/7] ppc/prep: add IBM RS/6000 43p machine

Hi,

This patchset adds an emulation of the IBM RS/6000 43p, also known as 7248.
I've fixed comments of Blue Swirl in this series, so I'm sending it as PATCH instead of RFC.

Andreas did some preliminary patches for OpenBIOS to support PReP machines, available at
git://repo.or.cz/openbios/afaerber.git branch prep.
43p emulation has been tested with this firmware, and also with the official firmware,
named P93H1904.IMG.

Command line may look like
qemu-system-ppc -M 43p -readconfig ibm_43p.cfg

Changes RFC v2 -> PATCH v1:
- rebased on master
- add a Nvram interface on m48t59
- kept ISA io_base in patch 3
- renamed QOM parent objects as parent_obj

Changes RFC v1 -> RFC v2:
- rebased on master
- works with OpenBIOS
- rework on m48t59 patches
- remove rs6000 debug port emulation (not strictly required)
- checkpatch.pl doesn't complain anymore

Known bugs/missing parts:
- incomplete MPC105 (PCI host bridge) emulation (memory controller)
- no video card (should be a S3)
- QEMU can't change endianness at runtime

OpenBIOS status:
- detects CPU and memory, then freezes with a "Dictionary space overflow"

Official firmware status:
- can boot from a IDE hard disk containing a PReP boot partition
- can't boot from IDE cdroms (overlapping commands not supported by QEMU IDE emulation)
- can't boot from floppies (READ commands are issued, but it seems completion is ignored)
- can't boot from network (detects the netcard, but doesn't use it)
- needs a hack to m48t59 device to work

Regards,

Hervé
